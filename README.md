# spatial
Utilities for geospatial processing and visualisation

Further ideas and packages to pursue:

* `stplanr::SpatialLinesNetwork()` and `igraph` to combine graph theory and geography (https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/transport.html#route-networks)
* WebGL-based vis of large spatial data with deck.gl (https://github.com/crazycapivara/deckgl)
* Crop network to SA1 and find graph-theoretic or OTP routed "centre" of that (betweenness or eigenvector centrality).
